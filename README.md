# ros2-wasm-binaries
Conda repository of ros2 packages cross-compiled with emscripten.

These packages were all built using [mbatc/robostack-wasm](https://github.com/mbatc/robostack-wasm)

You can use these packages by cloning the repository and adding it as a local channel in your conda configuration. [Micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html) is recommended so that you can create an emscripten-32 environment.
